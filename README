Tab Count Chrome Extension
==========================

This repository contains the source code for the **Tab Count** Chrome extension.
The extension displays the number of open tabs, lets you manage them, and now
uses Manifest V3 with a service worker background script.

Chrome Web Store: <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cfokcacdaonnckdmopmcgeanhkebei>

Development
------------

The project now includes a basic Jest setup. After installing dependencies
(e.g. with `npm install`) you can run the test suite with:

```
npm test
```

Tests currently verify that the extension manifest is using Manifest V3.
